# Feynman
Feynman conservation law checker given equations.

Reads in a PDF named `Feynman Diagrams and Conservation Laws Lab.pdf` and determines if charge, baryon number, electron lepton number, muon lepton number, and strangeness is conserved. 

I obviously cannot include the actual PDF as it is school material and would be against policy, but the parsed quations can be found in `feynman-parsed.txt`.
